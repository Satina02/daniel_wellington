                        <br />
                        <p className="p-text">It was a coincidental meeting halfway around the world that inspired the idea for Daniel Wellington. On this trip, our <br /> founder, Filip Tysander, met an intriguing British gentleman with impeccable yet understated style. The man had a <br /> particular fondness for wearing his vintage watches on old, weathered NATO straps. His name? Daniel Wellington.</p>
                        <p className="p-text">Inspired by his new acquaintance’s timeless style, Filip decided to create his own line of watches. Minimalistic and <br /> refined, the classic design with interchangeable straps that came to be has become a staple, with truly wide-ranging <br /> appeal. A few years on, this design is still part of the fabric of what makes Daniel Wellington so special.</p>

                        <br />
                        <p className="p-text">Daniel Wellington loved to wear his watches on old NATO straps. We liked the ingenuity of this combination so much <br /> that we wanted to incorporate the idea in our own line of watches. It was imperative for us to craft a modern yet truly <br /> classic watch. We wanted a clean and minimalistic design that would complement the various patterns and colours of the <br /> iconic NATO straps.</p>
                        <p className="p-text">After returning from his travels, Filip sat down and began to look at different samples and colour ways. It was important <br /> that he loved the watch himself, or he could never sell it and be proud of it. Slowly but surely, a beautiful watch emerged. <br /> It was thin, elegant and perfectly round. A testament to minimalistic Scandinavian design, with the precision and accuracy of a Japanese movement watch.</p>
                        <p className="p-text">This classic yet refreshingly crisp design can mix and match seamlessly with our colourful NATO strap, the smart leather <br /> strap and the beautifully crafted mesh strap. The Daniel Wellington style will appeal to almost everyone with a taste for <br /> classic and timeless design.</p>
